# PostsApp

The App Features

•	When there is no internet connection and the user would like to add / update / delete post , the app saves this operations and sync it when internet valid.
•	I built modular and scalable Android app using Kotlin, Android Architecture Components (LiveData, ViewModel & Room), Dagger, RxJava and RxAndroid among others.
•	I Used a combination of Retrofit, Rx, Room and LiveData, we are able to handle networking in the most effective way.
•	I Used the lifecycle aware viewmodels, the view observes changes in the model / repository.
•	All the data is first tried to be loaded from the db and then updated from the server. This ensures that the app is usable even in an offline mode.
•	Made unit testing using Robolectric and Mockito , Junit
